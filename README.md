## Primer Proyecto: Analyzing Students' Mental Health
This is a project in which I used PostgreSQL to explore the student database of a Japanese international university to analyze how the length of stay impacts the mental health of the international students present in the study.

### Description
Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
