## Primer Proyecto: Analyzing Students' Mental Health
This is a project in which I used PostgreSQL to explore the student database of a Japanese international university to analyze how the length of stay impacts the mental health of the international students present in the study.

### Description
Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

## Description of the dataset
The dataset  "train_FD001.txt" describes the degradation of an aircraft engine. The dataset was used for the prognostics challenge competition at the International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM08).  Data sets consist of multiple multivariate time series. Each time series is from a different aircraft engine â€“ i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user. This wear and variation is considered normal, i.e., it is not considered a fault condition. There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data. The data are contaminated with sensor noise.
